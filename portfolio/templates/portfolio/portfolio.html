    <div class="intro">
        <p>
            I've graduated from Pune University with a Statistics Major.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several years ago, I wanted to build my first web application. I had been doing
            light web development work (landing pages, contact forms) for a while, and
            wanted to see if I could build something more interactive. That's when I came across Python and its powerful frameworks that hooked me into development.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I've grown as a developer, I've worked with senior developers who have raised my standards for what's expected of any web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these experiences, I've had the opportunity to create memorable products that are not only enjoyable to use but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand.

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have actively engaged in various projects and initiatives, which have significantly contributed to my development as a software developer. </p>
            <p>Additionally, I devote time to practicing competitive programming on platforms such as LeetCode. This not only sharpens my algorithmic thinking but also enhances my ability to tackle complex problems efficiently.</p>
            Overall, my combined experiences in project work and competitive programming have been instrumental in shaping my skills as a developer.
